I usually develop websites in my spare time for fun.

<!--
I mostly enjoy working in C and web languages like HTML5 and CSS; although other languages are just as fine. <br>
I'm a fast learner and can learn pretty much anything if I try. <br>
I like hacking stuff and am currently working on my skills involving that. <br> 
I'm a backend/frontend developer, I do stuff like modding, building websites from scratch (I hate web builders), etc. -->

<br>

I'm not currently looking for a job, as I don't feel like I'm ready for that yet. These projects here are simply practice for when I go into the real world and implement **`SyNBIOSis`**, a programming platform for the mind.
