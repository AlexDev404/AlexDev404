I usually develop websites in my spare time for fun and work along with languages like:
- C
- C++ 
- JavaScript 🌐
- HTML
- CSS
- ReactJS ⚛
- Python 🐍
- Batchfile 👨‍💻
- Blockly 🧱 (just for the fun of it) 
among others

## What I'm Doing Now.. .
- Working on Blaze
- Creating scripts for the Mega2560 in the Arduino IDE
- Fixing syntax errors in [Extendify](https://github.com/AlexDev404/Extendify)
- Destroying myself trying to develop drivers for XenoOS (anyone reading this who knows how to build drivers **please** help me) [AlexDev404/Xeno](https://github.com/AlexDev404/Xeno)
- Recreating the song Soy Yo in Sonic Pi
- Learning [LOLCODE](https://github.com/justinmeza/lolcode-spec/blob/master/v1.2/lolcode-spec-v1.2.md)

I mostly enjoy working in C and web languages like HTML5 and CSS; although other languages are just as fine. <br>
I'm a fast learner and can learn pretty much anything if I try. <br>
I like hacking stuff and am currently working on my skills involving that. <br>
I'm a backend/frontend developer, I do stuff like modding, building websites from scratch (I hate web builders), etc.

<br>

I'm not currently looking for a job, as I don't feel like I'm ready for that yet. This here is just me sharpening up my skills for when I go into the real world and implement **`SyNBIOSis`**.
