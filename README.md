### I make the things I need, and share them to the world.

I like designing stuff when I'm alone and bored. Playing Zelda is my newfound passion. Throughout the years, my patience for things have improved because of programming which seems to require a lot of it. I know and am comfortable using a wide variety of programming languages and learn them whenever I need to. Learning programming languages of different paradigms has gotten pretty easy to do over the years â€” and picking one up has become even easier. I guess you could then call me a polyglot, which is probably who I am at this point in time.

I now fluently know most of **JavaScript** due to [Blaze](https://trail-blaze.github.io). It's one of my past projects which I intend to revive a couple years from now.

I mostly enjoy working in Rust and web languages like TypeScript; although other languages are just as fine.
I'm a fast learner and can learn pretty much anything if I try.
I like hacking stuff when I find that they need improvement.
I'm a frontend developer for now, but don't really consider myself a backend developer simply because I know a couple databasing software.
I do know how to make a basic REST API but that doesn't count

I intend to label myself a fullstack developer once I prove to myself that I am ready for real world applications.



<!--- I now am attending the University of Belize. These projects here are simply practice for when I go into the real world and implement **`SyNBIOSis`**, a programming platform for the mind. --->
