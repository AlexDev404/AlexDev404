### Yow Coderzz ðŸ‘‹

I'm AlexDev404 also known online as the Biggest Skid in the World.
I usually develop websites in my spare time for fun and work along with languages like:
-Skidding
-Skidding
-Skidding
-Skidding Again


## What I'm Doing Now.. .
- Working on Skid
- Creating Skidded Script for the Mega2560 in the Arduino IDE
- Fixing syntax errors in [Extendify](https://github.com/AlexDev404/Extendify)
- Destroying myself trying to develop skidded drivers for XenoOS (anyone reading this who knows how to build drivers **please** help me) [AlexDev404/Xeno](https://github.com/AlexDev404/Xeno)
- Recreating the song Soy Yo in Sonic Pi
- Learning [LOLCODE](https://github.com/justinmeza/lolcode-spec/blob/master/v1.2/lolcode-spec-v1.2.md) to skid from it.

I'm a fast Skidder and can Skid pretty much anything. <br>
I like Skidding stuff and am currently working on my Skidding skills. <br>
I'm a Skidder, I do stuff like Skidding from real dev (Neonite, Aurora, etc).

<br>

I'm not currently looking for a job, as I don't feel like I'm ready for that yet, as I am perfectly sustained by my own business, Atomica. This here is just me sharpening up my Skid skills for when I go into the real world and implement **`SyNBIOSis`**.
